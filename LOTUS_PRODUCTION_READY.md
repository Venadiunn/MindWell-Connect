## 📊 Expected AI Behavior

### Good Conversation Example:

**User:** "I'm feeling really anxious today"

**Lotus Companion:**  
"I hear that you're feeling anxious today, and that can be really uncomfortable. Anxiety has a way of making everything feel overwhelming, doesn't it?

Let's try something together right now. Take a slow breath in for 4 counts, hold for 4, then breathe out for 6. This longer exhale signals your nervous system to calm down.

What's been on your mind that might be contributing to this anxiety?"

### Response Pattern:
1. ✅ Validates feeling ("I hear that...")
2. ✅ Offers micro-skill (breathing technique)
3. ✅ Asks gentle question
4. ✅ Brief (2-3 paragraphs)
5. ✅ Warm and conversational tone

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

### API Key:
- Currently in `lib/services/chat_service.dart`
- ⚠️ **For production:** Move to environment variables
- Use `--dart-define` or backend proxy

### Recommendations:
1. Create a backend API that proxies OpenRouter calls
2. Store API key in backend environment variables
3. Frontend calls your backend, not OpenRouter directly
4. This protects the API key from being exposed in web builds

## 🌐 Web Deployment Specifics

### Flutter Web Compatibility:
✅ HTTP package works in web  
✅ Provider state management works in web  
✅ All UI components are web-compatible  
✅ No platform-specific code used  

### CORS (Cross-Origin):
- OpenRouter API supports CORS
- `HTTP-Referer` header identifies your app
- No additional CORS configuration needed

### Performance:
- Initial Flutter web load: ~2-5 seconds
- Chat responses: ~2-10 seconds (depends on OpenRouter load)
- Quick actions: Instant (UI), then AI processing time
